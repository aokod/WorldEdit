### Edits for Aedificium
[Lua](https://lua.org) plugin for [Cuberite](https://cuberite.org) which provides large-scale block edits and figure drawing.
<br>
Based off the [enginehub/worldedit](https://github.com/EngineHub/WorldEdit) and the [tvpt/voxelsniper](https://github.com/TVPT/VoxelSniper) plugins, using code from the [cuberite/worldedit](https://github.com/cuberite/WorldEdit) plugin by [Mathias](https://github.com/mathiascode).

### Features
1. Works with the [worldeditcui](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/worldedit-cui.25524) visualization plugin for Forge and LiteLoader.
2. Properly runs calculations in a container, evading problems with complex functions.
3. W/E API-compliant craftscripts and schematic formats.
